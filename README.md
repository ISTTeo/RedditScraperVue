### Motivation and current state

I wanted to get practice in Vue and after reading this tweet:

I had this idea. Make a simple app that given a subreddit or a user helps you find the top posts.

At first nothing you can't do in Reddit (maybe with less distractions) but I believe it could be improved in order to be more focused towards "crowd-sourced" wisdom and actually be useful.

But to be honest, it's just an excuse to learn more about Vue.

Currently (24-June-19) I have the basic functionality: I can get posts from subreddits, and posts&comments from users. I don't display more than the original post/comment and still have some rendering bugs (per example: rerendering comments after searching one user doesn't work for the description which stays the same as the old one). 

I have a few ideas but not sure if I will work a lot on this. The basic interest of getting stuff from a website was fullfilled and my ideas are just mixtures of the new things I learned to this point (and finding bugs, like that pesky rerendering one). 

Furthermore this gave me a few ideas for things that seem farfetched to me at this point, so I will probably try them to learn a bit more.
